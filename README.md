### A Java-8, cross platform, fully-featured, Game of Life simulator

The Game of Life is a game with a grid as its way to manipulate the squares to their on or off state. There is a strict set of rules that generate the next generation. With all of this in the original versions of the game, I have added more features such as inserting saving one's progress, inserting defined presets, turning on toroidal array, and changing, resolution, width, and height of the grid.
