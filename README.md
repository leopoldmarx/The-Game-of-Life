### A Java-8, cross platform, fully-featured, Game of Life simulator

The Game of Life is a game with a strict set of rules which generates the next generation. I have added more features such as saving one's progress, the ability to insert defined or user created presets, toggling toroidal array, and changing resolution, width, and height of the grid.
